fix scanner
we need an algo for identifying the which teeth it is ( identify and select) => on the basis of the box we can partition the images
change ui to be able to accept patient id => appointment => teeth 
	in the scan part => will only take the image
	in the preview part => mount , ability to choose images according to the person , appointment and teeth id ( not all nessecary dependent upon the prompt in a tabular format)

create mount frame only



future =>

	stiching images to create new images helping dentist in analysis
	use AI to do basic analysis of the teeth
	whatever Sir told in the video

ROHITH => 3, 2(server)
